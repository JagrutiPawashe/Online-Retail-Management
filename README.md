# Online-Retail-Management
Online retail is a booming industry, and SQL is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing retail data. This project will use SQL to create a database for an online retail store. The database will track products, customers, orders, and payments. It will also be able to generate reports on sales, inventory, and customer demographics.

The project will cover the following topics:

* Creating a relational database in SQL
* Inserting, updating, and deleting data from the database
* Querying the database to retrieve data
* Creating reports from the database
